### State Management in React

State can be defined as an object that houses data that changes over time in an application. In other words, state is a dynamic data storage that provides a mechanism for components to manage, keep track of changing data, and trigger re-rendering when it is updated.

- Local State using useState Hook
  
  The useState hook is the most basic way to manage state in a React component. It allows you to add state to functional components. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

- Global State using Context API

  For managing state that needs to be accessed by multiple components, the Context API is a good choice. It allows you to create a global state that can be shared across your component tree.

- Advanced State Management with Redux

  For more complex state management needs, Redux is a popular library. It provides a centralized store for all your application state and uses actions and reducers to manage state changes.
